Installation
============
For proper installation you need to clone project from git.

Surroundings
------------

The service can be installed on Windows 10 and CentOS 7 (not tested on other system versions).

Required predefined dependencies:


- Python v. 3.5 or higher is required.
- It is strongly recommended to create virtual surroundings for python dependencies installation.
- Python setuptools module can be installed via pip (pip install setuptools).


Dependencies installation
-------------------------

After surroundings installation launch *pip install* with *"-r requirements.txt"* parameter.

.. code-block:: bash

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Configuration
-------------
After dependencies installation configuration file should be set. File is placed in *"./luna_index_manager/configs/config.conf"*.

First launch and testing
------------------------
If all previous actions are executed successfully, server is ready to work. To start server please launch *run.py* \
script. While start you can add arguments: server message port and number of workers, servicing the server. \
By default 5060 port is used and one worker is launched. \
Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    ./run.py --workers=1 --port=5060 --config=./configs/myconfig.conf

After server is started, testing is recommended. To perform testing execute command

.. code-block:: bash

    python -m unittest tests.unittests_main

All tests should perform successfully.
