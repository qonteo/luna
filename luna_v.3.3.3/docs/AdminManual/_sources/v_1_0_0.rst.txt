v.1.0.0
=======

Improvements:
-------------

    1) Luna-admin service works as RESTfull api service.

    #) Luna-admin service is divided into two parts: *back* and *tasks*. Every part is RESTfull service. Back component
       gives access to view all the objects in the system: accounts, tokens, faces, persons. Also one can set long task
       (re-extract descriptors, clean up non-linked faces) from it. Second component process long tasks. It is assumed
       that administrator of luna-platform will use first component. Components is run separately.

    #) Removed  functionality of unblocking persons and lists.

    #)  Removed periodic tasks. Task on clean up not linked faces is run manually.

    #) Added several helpfull resources (see raml documentation).

    #) Added oracle database support

    #) Added Luna-Request-Id header

    #) Now ORIGIN is used in configs. Origin consists of "<schema>://<ip-address>:<port>"

    #) Add submodule to projects, some features, such as baseHandler, errors, utils, regexps and log moved there
