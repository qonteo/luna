v.1.2.0
========

Improvements:
-------------

    1) Updated LUNA CORE api version (13). This version of the LUNA API does not support the previous versions of
       LUNA Core.

    #) Add handler "LUNA-Request-Id", see raml. Helps uniquely identifying messages, corresponding to particular requests, in system logs.
       If it was not set system would will be set id in default format ("timestamp,UUID4"). This id would be return
       with response.

    #) Increase  connection to postgres count (2).

    #) Changed the library for work with images, now we use Pillow (pillow-simd_). It is faster then wand. Requirements
       is updated.

    #) Changed store for portraits. Now we use luna-image-store for portraits.

    #) Fix name of log files ("Luna_python_server_*" -> "luna-api_*")

Bugs fixed:
-----------


    1) Fixed matching by empty list if after removing element from list.



How to update from previous version:
------------------------------------

To update from previous version simply replace folders *app, error, base_scripts, tests, raml* and \
file *version.py*. It is strongly recommended to backup DB postgres and server.
