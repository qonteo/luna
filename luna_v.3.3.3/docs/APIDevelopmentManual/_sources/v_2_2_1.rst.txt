How to update from previous version:
------------------------------------

To update from previous version simply replace folders *luna_admin, tests, docs* and update dependencies from
requirements.txt.

To migrate faces' pictures from Luna-Api (only if portraits stored on hard drive using plugin) to Luna-Image-Store,
use script from *base_scripts/pictures_migration*. There is config file named *config.conf* in *pictures_migration*
with parameters, that needs by Luna-Image-Store and path with pictures.
To run migration use:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python run.py

To use another config, use *--config=./path_to_config/config.conf*.
