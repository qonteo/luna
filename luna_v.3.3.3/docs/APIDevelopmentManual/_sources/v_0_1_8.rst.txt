v.0.1.8
=======

Improvements:
-------------

	1) Complex test for descriptors and persons deletion testing is added. Test can be found in tests folder
	   in bigtest.py file.

	#) Automatic versioning is added in main.raml.

	#) sphinx-docs generation for CI is added.

	#) sphinx-docs is now ignored and now manually generated when needed (including CI).
	launch line *sphinx-build -b html -a ./sphinx_input ./sphinx_docs*.

Bugs fixed:
-----------

	1) If photo with enabled SEND_TO_S3 flag was not put in S3, function sendPhotoToLuna is terminated with error
	   and whole request is terminated with error (before fix, error was ignored and descriptor could be saved without photo).

	#) Version field in JSON is fixed.

How to update from previous version:
------------------------------------

To update from previous version simply replace folders *app, error, base_scripts, tests, sphinx_docs, raml* and \
file *version.py*. It is strongly recommended to backup DB postgres and server.
