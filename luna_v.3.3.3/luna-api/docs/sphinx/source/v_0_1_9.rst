How to update from previous version:
------------------------------------

To update from previous version simply replace folders *app, error, base_scripts, tests, sphinx_docs, raml* and \
files *version.py, config.py*. It is strongly recommended to backup DB postgres and server. To update passwords it's necessary
to install passlib from *pip* and  launch script *reset_passwords.py* from folder *base_scripts*.
