v.2.0.0
=======

Improvements:
-------------

    1) Changed the error handling mechanism, now we are use *VLException* instead *Result* (exceptions instead
       options).

    #) Used luna-image store for portraits storing.

    #) Now you can get thumbnails of portraits. See resource */storage/portraits/{descriptor_id}{thumbnail}* in
       raml documentation.

    #) Used luna-faces for storing faces, persons and lists. Now two tables exist in luna-api database (account and
       account tokens).

    #) Structure of project was refactored. Logic was moved to directory *luna_api*. File *run.py* you can find in
       this directory.

    #) Mechanism of blocking persons and faces was removed.

    #) Change several error codes affected not found objects, bad params and duplicate ids.

    #) Changed version of tornado, now we use version 5.0.1. For reinstall tornado you can execute following command:

        .. code-block:: bash

            pip install --upgrade --force-reinstall tornado==5.0.1

    #) Added LunaVL library build.

    #) Test work through LunaVL library.

    #) Luna3 python library is used to work with luna-faces.

    #) Added pagination for resources */account/tokens* and */storage/lists*

    #) Descriptors *last_update* and persons *create_time* includes time zone

    #) Parameter *STORAGE_TIME* removed from Luna API config, now it exists in luna-faces config

    #) Added oracle database support

    #) Now ORIGIN is used in configs. Origin consists of "<schema>://<ip-address>:<port>"

    #) Added ethnicities estimate, add query param "*estimate_ethnicities*" to request on resources
       "/matching/search" or "/storage/descriptors"  for getting ethnicity.

Bugs fixed:
-----------

    1) Fix objects miss when getting faces and persons from lists with pagination.

    #) Fixed rest-sphinx documentation

    #) Fixes boolean type in raml documentation for extract params (now 0 or 1)

How to update from previous version:
------------------------------------

To update from previous version simply replace folders *app, error, base_scripts, tests, raml* and \
file *version.py*. It is strongly recommended to backup DB postgres and server.

To migrate data from DB, which used by Luna API v.2, to DB, which using by Luna-Faces, use script from
*base_scripts/db_api_to_faces_migration*. There is config file named *config.conf* in *db_api_to_faces_migration*
with parameters, that need to databases. Before run migration, create backup of DB and stop any activities with DB,
including Luna API v.2. Also, it needs database, that using by Luna-Faces, to be already created. To run migration use:

    .. code-block:: bash

        python run.py

To drop tables after migration from Luna API v.2 DB at once, use flag *--clean*. To drop tables from Luna API v.2 DB without
migration, use flags *--skip-migration* with flag *--clean* together.
